    From below, the underbelly of a bird flying over the city looks like a shooting star.<br><br>
    Am I disappointed or relieved when I realize it's a bird? Are you? Maybe my wish wasn't ready, maybe the distance of stars intimidates me, maybe I see more beauty in creatures with wings.<br><br>
    When I am strung up high like that bird, lit from below, seen from below, will I look like a shooting star?<br><br>
    I wonder why Qiu Miaojin stabbed herself; I wonder why she didn't fly just one time.
