    <p class="story">
      The sun was red. On that day, we drove through hills and plains, plains and hills, with mountains in the rearview, and watched the sun set. It shifted straight down until it ducked under the horizon, a moment that we missed in favor of settling in to the new house. ‚ÄúSettling in‚Äù might not be the right phrase - we loaded in our bare necessities (changes of clothes, toothbrushes, and a small crate of food we brought with us) and walked around the empty house, dreaming about what Monday morning breakfasts we might have on the back porch and what weekend movie nights we might have staring at the east wall in the living room (currently bare, but we‚Äôd buy a tv as soon as we wanted one badly enough).
      <br><br>
      Post- phantom-family tour, I walked to the window, processing the lack of a red glowing orb, taking in the soft pastels that were left: a glowing orange, pink, yellow that reflected onto the clouds from below the horizon, a land that I never dared to dream about even though I knew it was in the same world as mine. Was anyone over there caught up in moving, about to miss the red sun that was nearly ready to fall beneath their horizon? Was anyone over there wondering if there was someone over here caught up in moving, who missed the red sun that had already fallen beneath the horizon?
      <br><br>
      We walked onto the back porch and silently turned our heads left to right, right to left, up and down, around, attempting to internalize every blade of grass in the field, lest we miss one and fail to appreciate this moment enough. The day was hot and dry, but the entrance into nighttime gifted us a breeze that made it bearable.
      <br><br>
      The sun had set, as I keep repeating, but it took me a while to remember that dusk follows sunset, and darkness follows dusk, and stars accompany darkness, minus the few clouds that I fixated on during my attempt to fully appreciate the scene. I remembered suddenly, so I turned suddenly and peered up suddenly, beyond the house and the trees that could block my vision. And in my mind I saw the moon, either a circle or a crescent or something in between. I envisioned exactly what I expected to see, but try as I did, I couldn‚Äôt find it in the sky. I searched for a few minutes and began to panic. It felt apocalyptic. I realized in hindsight shortly after that of course it must have been the one phase of the moon where it‚Äôs absent from the sky, just for the night, but I had never seen it before. New moon, a fitting novelty for the day I first saw it.
      <br><br>
      When I asked her about this day, the girl I was with at the time, who I last saw at that very house on the day I left, she said she remembered seeing a moon. I called her recently to check, so that I could be accurate in writing this story. But I think she lied. I called her just four days ago, in the morning-- no, around noon. She picked up on the third ring, ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù. I think she must have deleted my number and forgot my area code, or else she wouldn‚Äôt have picked up. I said it was me and asked her not to hang up, told her I just had one question and that I wouldn‚Äôt call again. I didn‚Äôt have to explain the day because I know she remembered. But I asked her if she saw a moon that day, if she remembered how we couldn‚Äôt find it, the fear we felt, and she said ‚Äúno, I remember the moon. A crescent, maybe a quarter. Unsure. I remember seeing the moon‚Äù and hung up. I think she lied because she knew I would doubt myself out of writing the story, not that we talked long enough for me to explain that I wanted to write something about it. Anyway. I know there wasn‚Äôt a moon, deep in my soul, distinctly in my memory, but for peace of mind I must disclose to you that she says she remembers one. Take it with many grains of salt, knowing that we hadn‚Äôt spoken since I left that house, knowing she has many reasons to hold the moon against me.
      <br><br>
      Our family dreams were never fulfilled and I don‚Äôt know what became of the house. When I called, I wondered what time it was for her. I suppose I lost the right to know long ago.
      <br><br>
      What no one has cared enough to tell me about leaving is that it‚Äôs never the last time. Each time, it feels so final and I think that I will live in this arrived reality forever, yet I never have. When we stood on that back porch, attempting to process the finality of what leaving our busy yet boring world had meant, I believed that I would stand there, in front of the sun that had already set, forever. And when I left on that fated day, planned out in all of twenty minutes, I believed that I would never leave a place again, never leave a person again, that I would never again need to. But leaving somewhere always means arriving at another place, a place that you will likely leave just as swiftly.
      <br><br>
      Now that I am ending this story, it feels like I am leaving this memory behind. And I wonder if I will ever fixate on it again as I am right now, as I did a few paragraphs ago. But no matter-- I am sure I will forge new memories, new fixations, new moons.<br><br>
